pip install streamlit

streamlit hello



Typically the steps you always takes are:

git clone <repo>
cd <repo>
pip install virtualenv (if you don't already have virtualenv installed)
virtualenv venv to create your new environment (called 'venv' here)
source venv/bin/activate to enter the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt to install the requirements in the current environment

# Create python environment 

> python3 -m venv .yourenvname              

> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt   

> streamlit run app.py
